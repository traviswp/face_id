		<!-- THE PROBLEM-->

		
		<h3>1. The Problem</h3>
		
			<h5>1.1 Background</h5>

			<p>
				This project was inspired by work being done in Dr. David Kotz's Lab which addresses Security & Privacy 
				issues in mobile healthcare devices. Some of the members of the lab were working with students from another
				school to construct a low-cost and mobile device known as a <i>Spirometer</i> with a camera installed on it. 
				A <i>Spirometer</i> is defined as:
			</p>
			
			<center>
				<p>
					<i>
						"...an apparatus for measuring the volume of air inspired and expired by the lungs. It is a precision 
						differential pressure transducer for the measurements of respiration flow rates. <br> 
						The spirometer records the amount of air and the rate of air that is breathed in and out over a specified period."
					</i> [8]
				</p>
			</center>
			
			<p>
				There are a number of reasons behind installing the camera on the device; two of the main reasons being:
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>(1)</b> To ensure that the user of the device is who they say they are...
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>(2)</b> To ensure that information about a valid user of the device is recorded under the appropriate record (assuming that multiple users are using this particular device)...
			</p>
			

			<h5>1.2 What we will be working on...</h5>
			
			<p>
				The lead-up to this project is interesting, but it should be clear that the scope of this project utilizes an already existing Spirometer device with a prototype camera installed. 
				<b>We intend to address the problem of trying to recognize the person</b> that is using the device so that the system can leverage that information to 
				determine if that person using the device is in fact a valid user of the device and/or that data about a user is recorded under the appropriate user's records.  
			</p>

			<p>
				While facial identification is a relatively well explored area, even recent research (as recent as 2012) shows that methods for recognizing
				faces have a much harder time when occlusions of the face you are trying to recognize are present.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this project we hope to explore various methods (described below) to address the problem of facial recognition but with two primary challenges that make this problem fairly unique:
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>(1)</b> The images we will be attempting to process with facial identification algorithms have low resolution due to the specs. of the camera and the need to send/retrieve images wirelessly.
				(<b>Note:</b> the exact resolution of the images is unknown as there have been some delays on getting the concrete specs. for the camera). 
				
				<br><br>
				
				<b>(2)</b> The actual patient images will have a consistent occlusion due to the fact that an image of the user will be captured while the device is in use (i.e. while the mouth piece for the Spirometer
				is in the user's mouth). However, we want to implement our algorithm in a more generic sense, whereby we can attempt to perform facial identification regardless of the type or location of the occlusion. 
				
				<br>
			</p>

		<!-- METHODS -->

		<h3>2. Methods</h3>

			<p>		
				For our application, we want to identify the patient in our test image automatically 
				by comparing the image against a pre-stored database of patient images. Our 
				database and test images will be taken under similar settings. In every image, the 
				patient will have a medical device in their mouth but may also have other occlusions 
				covering their face; therefore, we want to design our algorithm so that it can deal 
				with partial occlusions other than just the medical device that will be in the patient's 
				mouth.
			</p>		

			<p>		
				Face identification problems can be placed under two broad categories:
			</p>		

			<p>		
				<b>(1)</b>
					Example-based Methods -- such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [1], 
					Independent Component Analysis [2] and Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
					[3], use holistic image data to match test images against database images. 
					The recognition performance of these methods can be reduced by the 
					presence of partial occlusions [4].

				<br><br>

				<b>(2)</b>
					Feature-based Methods -- use local features in the face to match test images 
					to database images. Such methods are less sensitive to partial occlusions 
					compared to example-based methods; however, it has been shown that 
					incorporating apriori information about the partial occlusion into the 
					recognition process can improve it's performance [4, 5, 6].
			</p>		

			<p>		
				Min [4] presents an algorithm that addresses the problem of face recognition under 
				occlusions. The approach starts by detecting the occlusions and then processing 
				the non-occluded portion of the face separately [4]. The occlusion detection is done 
				using Gabor wavelets, followed by PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature 
				vector, and SVM while the occlusions are detected using local binary patterns. In 
				our implementation, we will try similar approaches for the detection; however, we 
				might also try other approaches such as the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform [7].
			<p>		

			<p>	
				The patient images that we will get will be low-resolution images which poses an 
				additional challenge for face recognition. The primary focus of our algorithm will 
				be to detect partially occluded faces; however, we will try to construct the 
				algorithm in such a way that it works well with low-resolution images. This would likely
				mean that we would augment Min's algorithm so that the feature descriptors that it 
				uses work well for low-resolution images.
			</p>

		<!-- DATA SETS -->

		<h3>3. Data Sets</h3>
		
			<p>
				We have found a number of data sets that contain one of the two issues (low resolution or occluded) with the images that we are trying to address in our facial recognition algorithm. However, 
				we have yet to locate a data set which contains images that accurately represent the problem we are really trying to address. We are hoping to receive test images captured from
				the camera mentioned above that will be installed on the Spirometer device; but we are currently unable to count on having these at our disposal during the course of this
				project. 
			</p>		

			<p>
				For the time being, however, we intend to utilize a few primary data sets:
			</p>		

			<p>
				<b>(1)</b> The 3D Face Database from the University of Milano Bicocca [9] contains some images with <i>occlusions of the lower-face</i>.

				<br><br>
				
				<b>(2)</b> The Database of Faces [10] contains low resolution (92x112 pixels), grey-scale images of various subjects, taken at different times, with varying lighting, facial expressions, and facial details/occlusions.
							Even though there is quite a bit of variation in these images, the subjects are said to be "in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some movement)." [10]

		<!-- TIMELINE -->

		<h3>4. Proposed Timeline</h3>
		
			<h5>4.1 Proposal</h5>
				<p>
					To start the process, we will do a comprehensive literature review and identify the 
					current state-of-the-art methods for face identification in the presence of partial 
					occlusions and for low-resolution images. 		
				</p>
		
		
			<h5>4.2 Milestone</h5>
				<p>
					Based on our initial review and subsequent research on the topic, we will decide on an algorithm to implement and what augmentations we will need to make 
					in order to create an algorithm that is able to detect partial-occlusions in low-resolution images simultaneously. 
					
					By the milestone, we hope to have a rudimentary implementation of our algorithm with some test results of it's performance.
